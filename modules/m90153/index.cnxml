<para id="fs-idm224651488">It may seem obvious that there are a multitude of cultural differences between societies in the world. After all, we can easily see that people vary from one society to the next. It’s natural to think that a young woman from a village in rural Kenya in Eastern Africa would have a different view of the world from a young woman from urban Mumbai, India—one of the most populated cities in the world.</para>
<para id="fs-idm544505344">Additionally, each culture has its own internal variations. Sometimes the differences between cultures are not as large as the differences within cultures. Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu wrote about <emphasis effect="italics">cultural capital</emphasis>, which consists of material goods, non-material attitudes, and knowledge that are specific to a certain economic class. Bourdieu grouped cultural capital into three categories: <emphasis effect="italics">embodied</emphasis> (a regional dialect), <emphasis effect="italics">objectified</emphasis> (possessions), and <emphasis effect="italics">institutionalized</emphasis> (academic credentials). In the U.S., some group culture into three categories as well: <term id="term-00001">high, low, and pop</term> (for popular).</para>
<section id="fs-id1546012">
<title>High, Low, and Popular Culture</title>
<para id="fs-idm505162384">Can you identify the Chief Financial Officer of three major corporations? How about the name of the server at three local hangouts? How many books do you own? How many social media sites do you visit? Is your family listed on the Social Register<sup>©</sup>? Have you ever heard of the Social Register<sup>©</sup>? In each pair, one type of knowledge is considered <term id="term-00002">high culture</term> and the other <term id="term-00003">low culture</term>.</para>
<para id="fs-idm513550256">This could be considered stereotyping by economic class rather than by race or gender, but sociologists use the term <term id="term-00004">high culture</term> to describe the <emphasis effect="italics">pattern</emphasis> of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in the highest or elite class segments of a society. People often associate high culture with intellectualism, political power, and prestige. In America, high culture also tends to be associated with wealth. Events considered high culture can be expensive, formal, and exclusive – attending a ballet, seeing a play, listening to a live symphony performance, or attending a prestigious university. Similarly, <term id="term-00005">low culture</term> is associated with the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in the lowest class segments of a society.</para>
<para id="fs-idm254365376">The term <term id="term-00006">popular culture</term> refers to the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in mainstream society. Popular culture events might include a parade, a baseball game, or the season finale of a television show. Music, anime, and cosplay are pieces of popular culture. Popular culture is accessible by most and is expressed and spread via commercial and social media outlets such as radio, television, movies, the music industry, publishers, and corporate-run websites. You can share a discussion of favorite football teams with a new coworker or comment on a reality show when making small talk in line at the grocery store. But if you tried to launch into a deep discussion on the classical Greek play <emphasis effect="italics">Antigone</emphasis>, few members of U.S. society today would be familiar with it. Although high culture may be considered by some as superior to popular culture, the lines between high culture and popular culture vary over time and place. Shakespearean plays, considered to be popular culture when they were written, are now part of our society’s high culture. Five hundred years from now, will our descendants consider <emphasis effect="italics">Dancing with the Stars</emphasis> as fine performance art?</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-idm261386096">A <term id="term-00007">subculture</term> is just what it sounds like—a smaller cultural group within a larger culture. People of a subculture are part of the larger culture but also share a specific identity within a smaller group.*</para>
<para id="fs-idm513571888">Thousands of subcultures exist within the U.S. Ethnic and racial groups share the language, food, and customs of their heritage. Other subcultures are formed through shared experiences. Biker culture revolves around an interest in motorcycles. Some subcultures are formed by people who possess traits or preferences that differ from the majority of a society’s population. The body modification community embraces aesthetic additions to the human body, such as tattoos, piercings, and certain forms of plastic surgery. But even as members of a subculture band together, they still identify with and participate in the larger society.</para>
<para id="fs-idm236742608">Sociologists distinguish subcultures from <term id="term-00008">countercultures</term>, which reject some of the larger culture’s norms and values. In contrast to subcultures, which operate relatively smoothly within the larger society, countercultures might actively defy larger society by developing their own set of rules and norms to live by, sometimes even creating communities that operate outside of greater society. Counterculture members are ‘against’ the dominant ruling culture and want to install their own values. Sub-culture members may want to change some things but established procedures are followed.</para>
<para id="fs-idm240664256">Cults, a word derived from culture, are also considered counterculture groups. The group “Yearning for Zion” (YFZ) in Eldorado, Texas, existed outside the mainstream and the limelight, until its leader was accused of statutory rape and underage marriage. The sect’s formal norms clashed too severely to be tolerated by US law, and in 2008, authorities raided the compound and removed more than two hundred women and children from the property. Many cults claim to be spiritual, often establishing themselves as a religion. When each of the three Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Islam, and Judaism) in the world began, they were treated as cults and suffered much oppression because of it.</para>

<title>Cultural Change</title>
<para id="fs-idm263372624">Cultures continually change because new items are added to material culture every day and in turn, meanings are assigned to them (non-material), which affects other cultural components. For example, a new technology, such as railroads or smartphones, might introduce new ways of traveling or communicating. New ideas, such as flash mobs or crowdfunding, enter a culture . Sociologists identify two broad categories of change as <term id="term-00009">innovation</term> (meaning new) and <term id="term-00010">diffusion</term> (to spread out). Material cultural change happens when new items are <emphasis effect="italics">discovered</emphasis> or <emphasis effect="italics">invented</emphasis> or enter a culture as a result of <emphasis effect="italics">globalization</emphasis>.</para>
<section id="fs-idm238388432">
<title>Innovation: Discovery and Invention</title>
<para id="fs-idm266839824">An <term id="term-00011">innovation</term> refers to an object or concept’s initial appearance in society—it is innovative because it is new. Innovations are discovered or invented. <emphasis effect="italics">Discoveries</emphasis> make known previously unknown but existing aspects of reality. In 1610, when Galileo looked through his telescope and discovered Saturn, the planet was already there, but until then, no one had known about it. When Christopher Columbus encountered Hispaniola, the island was, of course, already well known to its inhabitants. However, his discovery was new knowledge for Europeans, and it opened the way to changes in European culture, as well as to the cultures of the discovered lands. For example, new foods such as potatoes and tomatoes transformed the European diet, and horses brought from Europe changed hunting practices of Great Plains Native Americans.</para>
<para id="fs-idm229337008"><emphasis effect="italics">Inventions</emphasis> result when something new is formed from existing objects or concepts—when things are put together in an entirely new manner. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, electric appliances were invented at an astonishing pace. Cars, airplanes, vacuum cleaners, lamps, radios, telephones, and televisions were all new inventions. Inventions may shape a culture by replacing older ways of carrying out tasks, being integrated into current practices, or creating new activities. Their adoption reflects (and may shape) cultural values, and their use may introduce new norms and practices.</para>
<para id="fs-idm513823344">Consider the rise of mobile phones. As more and more people began carrying these devices, phone conversations no longer were restricted to homes, offices, and phone booths. People on trains, in restaurants, and in other public places became annoyed by listening to one-sided conversations. New norms and behaviors were needed for cell phone use. Some people pushed for the idea that those who are out in the world should pay attention to their companions and surroundings. Fortunately, technology found a workaround: texting, which enables quiet communication surpassed phone conversations as the primary way to communicate anywhere, everywhere.</para>
<para id="fs-idm250990256">When the pace of innovation increases, it can lead to generation gaps. Technological gadgets that catch on quickly with one generation are sometimes dismissed by an older generation that is skeptical or struggles to adopt them. The older generation might tune into a musician performing on public television while the younger generation prefers a livestream. A culture’s objects and ideas can cause not just generational but cultural gaps. Material culture tends to diffuse more quickly than nonmaterial culture; technology can spread through society in a matter of months, but it can take generations for the ideas and beliefs of society to change including methods for researching or learning information (e.g., library versus Internet search).</para>
<figure id="fs-idm258265536">
<media id="fs-idm240202048" alt="A graph showing usage of technology, innovations, or other new items or practices. In the first stage, 2.5 percent of people are the innovators.  In the next, 13.5 percent of people are the early adopters.  In the next 34 percent of people are the early majority. In the next, 34 percent of people are the late majority. In the last, 16 percent of people are laggards. The diffusion chasm occurs in the early adoption stage, just before the majority begins to adopt it.">

<caption>Technology Adoption Lifecycle — Sociologist Everett Rogers (1962) developed a model of the diffusion of innovations. As consumers gradually adopt a new innovation, the item grows toward 100 percent usage, or complete saturation within a society. This graph is frequently used in business, sales, technology, and cultural innovations. It can be used to describe how quickly different groups adopt (or begin using) a new technology or a new slang word, but note it is just a framework: not every innovation follows this exact pattern, but it provides a good foundation for discussion and prediction.

<para id="fs-idm247548208">Coined by sociologist William F. Ogburn (1957), the term <term id="term-00012">culture lag</term> refers to the time that passes between the introduction of a new item of material culture and its social acceptance. Culture lag can also cause tangible problems. The infrastructure of the U.S., built a hundred years ago or more, is having trouble supporting today’s more heavily populated and fast-paced life. Yet there is a lag in conceptualizing solutions to infrastructure problems. Municipalities struggle with traffic control, increased air pollution, and limited parking, which are all symptoms of culture lag. Although people are becoming aware of the consequences, overuse, or lack of resources, addressing these needs takes time.</para>

<section id="fs-idm257707072">
<title>Diffusion and Globalization</title>
<para id="fs-idm268424128">Another way material and nonmaterial culture crosses borders is through <term id="term-00013">diffusion</term>. Like a gas in a laboratory experiment, the item or idea spreads throughout. Diffusion relates to the process of the integration of cultures into the mainstream while <term id="term-00014">globalization</term> refers to the promotion and increase of interactions between different regions and populations around the globe resulting in the integration of markets and interdependence of nations fostered through trade.</para>
<para id="fs-idm543618720">Ideas concepts, or artifacts are often diffused, or spread, to individuals and groups, resulting in new social practices. People might develop a new appreciation of Thai noodles or Italian gelato (ice cream). Access to television and the Internet has brought the lifestyles and values portrayed in U.S. sitcoms into homes around the globe and vice versa. Twitter feeds from public demonstrations in one nation have encouraged political protesters in other countries. When this kind of diffusion occurs, ideas from one culture are introduced into another, often before the associated material objects. The graph above displays when diffusion typically occurs, essentially driving an innovation to spread beyond its earliest adopters to the wider majority of people.</para>

<title>Summary</title>
<para id="fs-idm544341328">Sociologists recognize that there is a dominant culture or cultural practice that is dominant often characterized as the norm in a society as well as different types of cultures within societies. Societies also consist of many subcultures (a smaller cultural group within a larger culture). Some arise as a result of a shared identity or interest. Countercultures reject the dominant culture’s values and create their own cultural rules and norms. Cultural change can happen through invention or discovery. Cultures evolve via new ideas and new ways of thinking. In many modern cultures, the cornerstone of innovation is technology, the rapid growth of which can lead to cultural lag (time from creation or introduction to social acceptance). Technology is also responsible for the spread of both material and nonmaterial culture that contributes to globalization (the increase of movement and exchange of goods and ideas all over the planet).</para>
